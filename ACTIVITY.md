  I have worked on the initial commit of the repositories and organizations. I worked on F9 / F10 of A1 from W1 to early W2 as this was dependent on some docerFile and docker compose.

  - https://github.com/doda25-team13/model-service/pull/8
 
  I have worked on debugging the code for A1 and I believe that everything is now implemented except F11. In addition I went through both PRs regarding steps 5-12 and 13-17 for A2, and added some comments where the tasks were crashing for me, and specified how I fixed those issues locally. I have also started on steps 18 & 19 for A2, but it does not work yet 😢.
